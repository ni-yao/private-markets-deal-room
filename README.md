# The Deal Room — on Microsoft Teams

An **AI-native private-equity deal-flow workspace that lives inside Microsoft
Teams**. Deal teams source, screen, and run diligence from the channel they
already work in — **ask an @mentionable agent in natural language**, read a
**channel-native dashboard**, and move deals **stage to stage** — with every
answer **grounded in the live deal record** and **scoped to who is asking**.

Built on **Azure AI Foundry** (live model inference via managed identity), a Teams
**Bot Framework** agent + an **Entra-SSO channel tab**, deployed with a
subscription-agnostic **Bicep** accelerator on **Azure Container Apps**.

## 🤖 Talk to your deals — the conversational agent

**`@Deal Room Assistant`** is a Teams bot you @mention in any deal channel. It
replies in **natural language, grounded in that specific deal** — it works out
*which* deal from the channel itself, so you never restate the company or deal name.

**Ask it the way you'd ask a colleague:**

> 💬 *@Deal Room Assistant, what's the investment thesis here, in three lines?*
> 💬 *@Deal Room Assistant, summarise the latest diligence findings and open risks.*
> 💬 *@Deal Room Assistant, what's the current valuation and the key financials?*
> 💬 *@Deal Room Assistant, how does the retail MD read this opportunity?*
> 💬 *@Deal Room Assistant, what changed on this deal this week?*

![The conversational agent answering in the Teams interface — grounded in live deal data](teams-app/docs/teams-agent-chat.png)

<sub>*The Deal Room agent in the Teams tab: asked in plain language, it lists every deal with stage, status and IC readiness — grounded via the live deal tools (`mcp_dealroom.list_deals`).*</sub>

Behind every reply:

- **Channel-grounded** — resolves the deal from a durable channel↔deal map (with a
  company-name fallback), then calls the **live** deal tools (`get_deal`, financials,
  diligence, signals) so answers reflect the current record, not a snapshot.
- **Persona-aware** — one bot routes to the right specialist lens: **analyst**,
  **retail MD**, **supply-chain MD**, **AI MD**, or **partner**, and frames the
  answer from that viewpoint.
- **Identity-gated** — what it will tell you (and do) depends on **who is asking** —
  see [Identity-aware access](#-identity-aware-access-rbac) below.

## 📊 The Teams dashboard (channel tab)

An **Entra-SSO channel tab** renders the deal workspace **natively inside Teams** —
no separate portal, no second sign-in. SSO carries the signed-in user through, so
the dashboard knows *who* is looking.

- **Home command centre** — fund KPIs, the live origination funnel, and the
  deals-in-diligence roster.
- **Per-deal detail** — thesis, financials, diligence, signals and news for the deal
  the channel is scoped to.
- **Inline chat panel** — the same conversational agent, docked beside the data.
- **Proactive Adaptive Cards** — deal events post into the channel as cards with a
  deep link back to the tab, turning the channel into the deal's activity feed.
- **Native Teams theming** — light / dark / high-contrast, with a deal-focused layout
  when the tab is pinned to a single deal channel.

## 🗂️ Stage 1 & Stage 2 — the deal areas

The app *is* the process: two stages joined by the **PURSUE** gate.

### Stage 1 · Origination & Screening — the funnel

| Area | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Deal Sourcing** | A CxO Signals explorer (M365 mail / chats / meetings + Dynamics 365 CRM), a News & Filings desk with an AI **catalyst classifier**, and Analyst Reports thesis context. |
| **Sourcing framework** | Fund Mandate *gates* · Investment Themes *guide* · Screens *rank* — a discover-to-score loop. |
| **Auto Screen → Triage** | Candidates are scored and triaged against the mandate. |
| **Screening Gate** | A decision desk where the MD records **PURSUE** on the gate-ready shortlist, creating a screened deal. |

![Stage 1 — Origination & Screening in the Teams tab](teams-app/docs/teams-stage1.png)

**Deep-dive analytics on any target.** Expand a candidate for a grounded workup —
**SEC EDGAR filings**, a Morningstar quality read, and an **AI-generated analyst
report** (sector outlook, competitive position, key risks, and a screening
recommendation) — all sourced live and cited:

> ⚡ **PURSUE** provisions the deal's collaboration space — a real **Teams channel**
> and a **SharePoint virtual data room** — via delegated Microsoft Graph, with a
> durable channel↔deal mapping that keeps the agent's context correct as deals scale.

### Stage 2 · Diligence & Approval — the deal hub

| Area | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Launch** | Stands up the diligence workspace — DD checklist, playbook templates, and advisor-paired swimlanes, each node linking out. |
| **Diligence** | The agent works the deal across specialist personas, grounded in the live record and the data room. |
| **Synthesis** | Findings and risks roll up for the investment committee. |
| **Approval & Execution → Archive** | The MD / partner records the decision; the deal is executed and archived. |

![Stage 2 — Diligence & Approval in the Teams tab](teams-app/docs/teams-stage2.png)

## 🔐 Identity-aware access (RBAC)

What the agent returns — and what it will *do* — depends on the **requesting Teams
user's identity**, resolved server-side (a client can never widen its own powers):

| Role | Personas available | Stage-2 deal data | Write actions |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Partner** | all specialists | ✓ | ✓ |
| **Deal team** | analyst + all MDs | ✓ | ✓ |
| **Analyst / member** | analyst only | — (denied) | — (read-only) |

- **Graceful downgrade** — an unauthorised persona request is quietly narrowed to a
  read-only analyst view rather than refused, so the conversation keeps flowing.
- **Stage-2 gating** — diligence / approval data is withheld from read-only roles.
- A **partner** and an **analyst** asking the *same* question get appropriately
  different answers.

![Role-gated access — an Analyst is blocked from a Stage-2 deal in the Teams tab](teams-app/docs/teams-rbac.png)

<sub>*Viewing as an Analyst, opening a Stage-2 deal returns a lock — "restricted to the deal team" — while a partner or deal-team member sees the full record.*</sub>

## Under the hood — one backend, two surfaces

A single application, a single source of truth, presented through two complementary
tiers that run side by side:

| Tier | Container app | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **Deal Room (web + API + data)** | `ca-dealhub-orch-*` (image `deal-room`) | The full browser SPA **and** the API/data plane — Cosmos DB, the MCP server, Foundry agents, and Microsoft Graph provisioning. **The only tier that holds data.** |
| **Teams interface** | `ca-dealhub-teams-*` (image `dealhub-teams`) | The thin Teams-native front end — the channel tab + the conversational bot. Holds **no data**; every read/write forwards to the orchestrator over `/api`. |

> **Two web apps, by design — not a duplicated version.** The Teams tier proxies all
> data to the one backend (`SHARED_BACKEND_URL`), so there's a single data source and
> nothing to keep in sync. Browser users get the full dashboard; Teams users get a
> channel-native view of the *same* deal record.

**Teams platform capabilities used** — Entra **SSO** (tab per-user context) · **Bot
Framework** conversational bot (single-tenant) with a Teams channel · **channel tabs** ·
**Adaptive Cards** proactive alerts · **deep links** back to the tab · **org app
catalog** distribution & install · per-deal **Teams channels** + **SharePoint** data
rooms · an **MCP** endpoint that lets **M365 Copilot** and hosted agents call the same
grounded deal tools.

### Why it matters

- **Zero context-switching** — Q&A, diligence, and approvals happen in the channel the
  deal team already lives in; adoption doesn't hinge on opening a separate app.
- **Grounded and current** — the bot and tab read the live record through one backend,
  so there's no stale copy or "which version?" ambiguity.
- **Least-privilege by identity** — specialists, Stage-2 data, and write actions are
  scoped to the requester's role.
- **Auditable deal spaces** — each deal gets its own channel + SharePoint data room.
- **Portable accelerator** — the whole experience is parameterised Bicep; a new tenant
  stands it up from app registrations + a handful of parameters.

## Run locally

```powershell
cd app
npm install
npm run build --prefix client   # build the client once
$env:PORT = 8080
node server.js                  # http://localhost:8080  (demo mode without a Foundry endpoint)
```

The app runs in **demo mode** out of the box (seeded AI responses). Set
`AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` / `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT` to point at a deployed Foundry
model for live inference.

## Deploy to Azure

The Bicep is **subscription-agnostic** — pick the subscription at deploy time.

```powershell
az group create -n rg-dealroom-dev-swc -l swedencentral
az deployment group create -g rg-dealroom-dev-swc \
    -f infra/main.bicep -p infra/main.dev.bicepparam
# then build & push the app image to the created ACR and point the Container App at it
```

See `infra/README.md` and `app/README.md` for the full details, and
`app/graph/README.md` for the Microsoft Graph mailbox-signals setup.

## Notes

- Authentication is via **managed identity** end to end — there are no secrets in
  this repository.
- Microsoft 365 / Copilot, Dynamics 365, SharePoint and Purview are SaaS /
  tenant-level and are configured via licensing / admin portals, not by Bicep.
